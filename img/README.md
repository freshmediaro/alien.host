# Image Assets

This directory contains the following image assets for the OS-style dashboard:

1. `avatar.png` - User avatar image
2. `square-logo.png` - Square logo for the application
3. `coin-icon.png` - Icon for the currency widget

Note: For the static implementation, these images need to be added manually. When integrating with Laravel, these will be stored in the public/images directory.
